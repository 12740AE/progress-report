# Welcome to Smart Dorm/Home Security 

## 1. Current progress

We’ve procured all of the sensors we plan on using, to get an initial feel of what kind of readings/range of readings we can expect to get. The following was procured, along with 3.5’’ door hinges to build the model door for this project:

*Sensors needed*
